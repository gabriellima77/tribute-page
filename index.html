                    <h2>Here's a time line of Steve Jobs's life:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1955</strong> - Born in San Francisco, California</li>
                        <li><strong>1968</strong> - When he was 13, Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett after Jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project.</li>
                        <li><strong>1972</strong> - Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. He insisted on applying only to Reed although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford.</li>
                        <li><strong>1974</strong> - Jobs returned to his parents' home in Los Altos and began looking for a job. He was soon hired by Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California, which gave him a job as a technician.</li>
                        <li><strong>1976</strong> - Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home.</li>
                        <li><strong>1977</strong> - Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire.</li>
                        <li><strong>1978</strong> - Jobs was worth over $1 million when he was just 23 years old.</li>
                        <li><strong>1983</strong> - Jobs lured John Sculley away from Pepsi-Cola to serve as Apple's CEO, asking, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?"</li>
                        <li><strong>1984</strong> - An emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apple's annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium.</li>
                        <li><strong>1985</strong> - The Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear, and it strengthened Sculley's position in the company.</li>
                        <li><strong>1986</strong> - Jobs funded the spinout of The Graphics Group (later renamed Pixar) from Lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10 million.</li>
                        <li><strong>1996</strong> - Apple announced that it would buy NeXT for $427 million. The deal was finalized in February 1997,[135] bringing Jobs back to the company he had cofounded.</li>
                        <li><strong>2003</strong> - Jobs was diagnosed with cancer.</li>
                        <li><strong>2011</strong> - dies at the age of 56.</li>
